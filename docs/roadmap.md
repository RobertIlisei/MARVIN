# Roadmap

What's in flight, what's deferred, and what MARVIN deliberately won't do. The chronological record of what shipped, when, and why lives in [`docs/history/CHANGELOG.md`](./history/CHANGELOG.md). Material decisions live in [`docs/decisions/`](./decisions/).

## In flight

_Active work. Add a one-line entry when a piece of work starts; move it out (to CHANGELOG, with the date) when it lands._

_(nothing in flight — last shipping milestone was v1.3 on 2026-05-05)_

## Recent milestones

The high-water marks. Diagnostic detail per release in the [changelog](./history/CHANGELOG.md).

- **2026-05-05 — v1.3 Fully-native IDE surface** ([ADR-0021](./decisions/0021-webview-removal-fully-native-swift.md)). WebView removed end-to-end; native SwiftUI replaces every web-rendered panel. 8 milestones: WebView removal, MRU file picker, Find in Files (ripgrep), Symbol Search (graph-backed), diff gutter, file history, build task palette, diagnostics panel + clickable status badge.
- **2026-05-04 — Phase ADRs 0017–0020** lay out the sub-phases that v1.3 collapsed.
- **2026-04-26 — v1.2 audit-driven hardening pass.** Closed every 🔴 finding from the full audit. Permission gate load-bearing in `auto` mode, `BASH_HARD_DENY` plugged ([ADR-0015](./decisions/0015-auto-mode-policy-floor-and-audit-log.md)), confirm-prompt redesign, Honeycomb env race fix, `/api/chat` cwd validation, TopBar collapse.
- **2026-04-21 — v1.1 install-app + scout subagents.** `bin/marvin install-macos-app` + launchd user agent ([ADR-0016](./decisions/0016-swift-migration.md) replaces the original Tauri wrapper from [ADR-0010](./decisions/0010-desktop-wrapper-tauri.md)). Read-only scout subagents ([ADR-0014](./decisions/0014-scout-subagents-read-only.md)).
- **2026-04-17 — v1 ship.** Phases 1–4: chat surface, file tree, terminal, diff viewer, project picker, cost tracker, personality toggle, graph panel.

## Deferred (blockers, not capacity)

### Honeycomb MCP integration for observability

Would register as `marvin-honeycomb` and expose trace querying as tools the executor could invoke while debugging production issues. **Blocker:** requires a Honeycomb account + team-specific configuration; baking that into MARVIN's source violates the [isolation contract](./concepts/isolation-contract.md). Belongs in `<workDir>/.marvin/` config; no shipping ETA until a user has a Honeycomb environment to be the first to try.

### Test coverage beyond the write-channel security layer

The Vitest harness covers `fs-sandbox` / `fs-write-policy` / `fs-constants` / `fs-write-confirm-registry` and the new Swift logic targets (`MARVINLogic`, `MARVINTests`). The Agent SDK interaction loop, the React/SwiftUI shells, and individual API routes remain uncovered — still opportunistic. See [Testing](./development/testing.md).

### Real Developer ID + notarization

Today's `bin/marvin install-macos-app` produces an ad-hoc-signed `.app`; first launch needs right-click → Open. Real Developer ID + notarization removes the Gatekeeper warning and unlocks a pre-built signed `.app` distributed via GitHub Releases. **Blocker:** requires an Apple Developer account (~$99/yr) and CI plumbing for notarization.

## Not planned

Things MARVIN deliberately won't do. See [Vision](./business/vision.md) for the reasoning.

- Multi-agent orchestration ([ADR-0001](./decisions/0001-single-assistant.md)).
- Cross-platform desktop (Windows / Linux).
- Hosted SaaS with shared state.
- Cross-project memory.
- Broad "auto-mode heuristics" that switch models based on guessed complexity ([ADR-0002](./decisions/0002-default-to-opus-4-7.md)).
